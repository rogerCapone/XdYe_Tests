# XdYe Tests

Here you will find a set of functions that will allow us to check XdYe Smart Contract consistency.

More information about XdYe Testing can be found at: 

https://rogercapone.gitbook.io/xdye-documentation/testing-smart-contracts/testing-overview

Testing environment we have created for testing all XdYe structure is based on:

* Terminal containing Ganache-cli
> ganache-cli

* Terminal on project root for deploying Smart Contracts
> truffle migrate --reset

* Terminal on project root for running scripts for testing purposes
> node testingFileFromXdYe.js

Here we can see the environment:
Orange: Ganache-CLI
Black: Smart Contract Deployment
Purple: Script Execution
